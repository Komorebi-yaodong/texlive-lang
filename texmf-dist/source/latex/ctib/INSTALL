0. Introduction

While being based on the original works by R. Schwartz, J. Sparkes,
S. Sirlin, B. Steiner, N. Preining e.a., cTibTeX, yet another Tibetan
implementation, offers complete, seamless support for Tibetan in
TeX and LaTeX2e *without* resorting to external preprocessors. Tibetan
can be entered in transliteration without virtually anything peculiar
to observe.


1. Installation

Unpack the archive ctib4tex<nn>.zip in some temporary directory.

teTeX users can proceed to section 1.2, MikTeX users should read
section 1.3.


1.1 emtex

If you are an emtex user, read and follow the instructions in the
file EMTEX.


1.2 teTeX (and other TeX systems based on the TeX Directory Structure)

Create subdirectories, either in your main TeX installation, or
in any local tree, with the following structure:

	mkdir $TEXMF/tex/latex/ctib/
	mkdir $TEXMF/fonts/source/public/mfinput/ctib/
	mkdir $TEXMF/fonts/tfm/ctib/
	mkdir $TEXMF/doc/ctib/

Copy the appropriate contents into the newly created directories:

	cp $TMP/texinput/*	$TEXMF/tex/latex/ctib/
	cp $TMP/mfinput/ctib/*	$TEXMF/fonts/source/public/mfinput/ctib/
	cp $TMP/tfm/ctib/*	$TEXMF/fonts/tfm/ctib/
	cp $TMP/doc/*		$TEXMF/doc/ctib/

Rehash the file name database by executing texhash.


1.3 MikTeX

Read and follow the instructions in the file MIKTEX.


2. Running cTibTeX

cTibTeX is now ready for use. It is activated by stating

\usepackage{ctib}

in the preamble of your LaTeX2e document or by saying

\input ctib

in your TeX document.
