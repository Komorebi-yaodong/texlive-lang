How to install eFrench under Linux  
june 6th 2012, for eFrench, RayJ
----------------------------------

  This eFrench installation has been tested with TeXLive 
but should be valid for all Linux systems. 
This distribution abides by the LPPL copyright. 

Installation instructions
=========================

Put the french directory (and if necessary also the 
msg directory) in place beeing accessible by 
the \input command. Under TeXLive, for example 
here (~ is the user's directory)
   ~/texmf/tex
or here
   ~/texmf/tex/plain
(or in the system TDS under tex/plain)
This way to do has been sucessfully tested under Ubuntu (9 to 11)

Notice
------
If for any reason french.sty after installation announces 
that msg.sty or msg-msg.tex is missing, then read the directives 
from Probl_Msg.txt, here in the install directory.

PS : 
1.   Messages are ANSI coded (latin9)      
2.   The language.dat file must define french as a
     language, it's generally the case
3.   For frenchle users a conflict can arise with the default frenchle
   (installed for example under /usr/share/texmf-texlive/tex/latex/frenchle)
     A solution is to suppress that directory with its whole content.
      (followed by $sudo texhash)
     Another (easier) is to use french.sty instead of frenchle.sty

Documentation 
=============
  The user's manuals efrench.pdf and frenchle.pdf are in french.
  Frenchle.pdf is included because it is also valid for efrench
  as a good introduction to it's possibilities. And frenchle 
  is now a part of e-french.
