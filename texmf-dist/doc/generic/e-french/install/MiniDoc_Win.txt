How to install eFrench under Windows
june 6th 2012, for eFrench, RayJ
----------------------------------

  This eFrench installation has been tested with MiKTeX 
but should be valid for all TeX motors. 
This distribution abides by the LPPL copyright. 

Installation instructions
=========================

Put the french directory (and if necessary also the msg directory) 
in a place beeing accessible by the \input command.
Under MikTeX 2.8, for example here 
   c:\LocalTexMf\tex\
or here
   c:\LocalTexMf\tex\plain\
(or in the system TDS under tex\plain\)

 and announce it to  MikTeX 
(Maintenance - Setting - Roots - Add ...)

   
This way to do has also been tested under MikTeX 2.9

Notice
------
If for any reason french.sty after installation announces 
that msg.sty or msg-msg.tex is missing, then read the directives 
from Probl_Msg.txt, here in the install directory.

PS : 
1.    Messages are ANSI coded (latin9)      
2.    The language.dat file must define french as a
      language, it's generally the case

Documentation 
=============
  The user's manuals efrench.pdf and frenchle.pdf are in french.
  Frenchle.pdf is included because it is also valid for efrench
  as a good introduction to it's possibilities. And frenchle 
  is now a part of e-french.
