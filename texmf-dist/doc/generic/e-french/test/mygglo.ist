%% This is a MAKEINDEX style file which should be used to generate the
%% formatted change history for use with the doc style option.  The TeX
%% commands used below are defined in doc.sty.  The commands for MAKEINDEX
%% like `level' `item_x1' are described in `` Makeindex, A General Purpose,
%% Formatter-Independent Index Processor'' by Poheng Chen.

%% Since the standard MAKEINDEX implementation have very limited space for
%% their items some of the change entries might fall through.  This is
%% unfortunate but I think I can live with it for the moment.

%% We disable scanning of macro names inside the index because there
%% exists a style option to work with doc.sty which is capable of scanning
%% every \verb command. This would otherwise produce recursion.
