Font generation tools of cspsfonts
----------------------------------
Petr Olsak,  2012

The script fontgen was used to generate the metrics of cspsfonts pckage.
The script mkf generates one ``normal'' metrics.
The script mkc generates one ``Caps&SmalCaps'' metrics.

The program kenroff removes small (invisible) kerns form AFM metric in order
to do the tfm more simple. The kerns smaller then 9/1000 of font size was
removed.
