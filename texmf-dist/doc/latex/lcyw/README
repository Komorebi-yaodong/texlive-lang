Classic Cyrillic CM Virtual Fonts for LaTeX

This small set of files provides Russian/Bulgarian languages support for 
LaTeX users at the base of the Type 1 copies (Cyrillic part by B.Malyshev) 
of classic CM fonts (OT1 part by D.E.Knuth, Cyrillic part by A.Samarin & 
N.Glonti) which present in any TeX distribution. These virtual fonts are 
using LCYW encoding. LCYW is almost subset of T2A (see `lcyw.dtx' for 
details). This encoding can be used via `fontenc' package.  This provides 
support only for OT1, guillemets, numero sign, and Russian alphabets 
symbols. However LCYW option to `fontenc' is not enough to provide copy & 
search features of the pdf viewers because standard `cmap' package lacks 
support for the virtual fonts. The LCYW encoding companion package 
`cmap-cyr-vf' should be used together with `cmap' to provide such support.

This encoding (unlike old LCY encoding) is compatible with all LaTeX 
features.
