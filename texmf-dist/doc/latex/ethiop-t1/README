This is a set of Type1 fonts for ethiop.sty, a LaTeX package for 
typesetting Ethiopian languages. The 44 Postscript fonts included in this 
collection were created from the original Metafont sources with mftrace. 
Despite the fact that potrace does an amazing job, the quality of the 
individual glyphs is by no means as good as in the original bitmap 
version, so please do NOT use them for printing purposes. They look 
pretty much ok in pdf files.

Please report any bugs (missing glyphs, etc.) to:
