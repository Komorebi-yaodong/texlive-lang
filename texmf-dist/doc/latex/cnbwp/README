Package: cnbwp   Version 2013.12                               1 January 2014
=============================================================================

The purpose of the package is to support proper formatting of Working Papers
of the Czech National Bank (WP CNB). The package was developed for CNB but it
is intended also for authors from outside CNB.

The documentation is written both in Czech and English:
cnbwp-manual-cs.pdf = Czech manual
cnbwp-manual-en.pdf = English manual

The doc/ directory contains not only the manual with its source files but also
a few sample files.


Installation:

1. put cnbwp.cls and cnbwpsizes.clo to the directory where latex expects packages,
   preferably $TEXMF/tex/latex/cnbwp

2. put abbrv.bst to a directory where bibtex expects bst styles
   preferably $TEXMF/bibtex/bst/cnbwp

3. put all doc/* files to a directory where texdoc looks for
   documentation, preferably $TEXMF/doc/cnbwp


The license of the package is LPPL.
