"Getting up and running with AMS-LaTeX" (contained in the file
amshelp.tex) is a primer on using AMS-LaTeX.  It's intended for people
with at least some experience using TeX, AMS-TeX, or LaTeX.

This is an attempt to get you up and running with AmS-LaTeX as quickly
as possible.  These instructions (along with the template file
template.tex) won't be a substitute for the full documentation, but
they may get you started quickly enough so that you'll only need to
refer to the main documentation occasionally.

In addition to descriptions of the basics of AMS-LaTeX, there are
sections with careful descriptions of the various environments for
displayed mathematics, how to use Xy-pic to draw commutative diagrams,
and how to use amsrefs to create a bibliography.
