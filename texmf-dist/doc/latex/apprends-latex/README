Apprends LaTeX !

Apprends LaTeX ! (Learn LaTeX!) is a French documentation aimed at LaTeX
beginners.

A PDF file is provided for convenience.

If you want to build the documentation from sources, you will need:

- A TeX distribution containing pdflatex, latexmk and the various packages used.
  TeX Live 2010 is recommended as it includes all that.

- A Perl interpreter.

- GNU make.

This works fine on a UNIX system.  I've never tested it elsewhere.

Then you will have to follow these steps.

1. Change to the exemples directory:

   cd exemples

2. Run the polices.pl and the beamer-themes.pl Perl scripts:

   ./polices.pl
   ./beamer-themes.pl

   Both use /usr/pkg/bin/perl (this is the standard location of the Perl
   interpreter on a NetBSD system using pkgsrc, which is what I'm using) as the
   path for the Perl interpreter (in the first line of each file).  If yours is
   different, you have to change it before running these script.

3. Run GNU make:

   gmake (or make, depending on your system)

   This will take some time, as it generates LaTeX source files and PDF files
   for a lot of examples.

4. Return to the top directory:

   cd ..

5. Run latexmk on Apprends_LaTeX.tex:

   latexmk -pdf Apprends_LaTeX.tex
