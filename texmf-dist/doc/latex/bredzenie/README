When developing LaTeX classes one needs some sample text to
demonstrate the layout. An often used option is the lipsum package
providing the classic pseudo-Latin “lorem ipsum dolor sit amet…”. A
drawback of this package is that it is Latin, so it doesn’t emulate
the ”look and feel” of a particular language. For the development of
Polish document classes I have created the package bredzenie, which
provides access to several paragraphs of pseudo-Polish generated with
Hidden Markov Models and Recurrent Neural Networks trained on a corpus
of Polish.

Installation: copy bredzenie.sty to a directory in the TeX’s path.
