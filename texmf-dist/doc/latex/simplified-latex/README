 The file simplified-intro.ps is the postscript file, ready for 2-sided

 This is a quick entry to Latex designed for students in an 
 undergraduate seminar.  Basic objectives and scope are given in its 
 Preface.  I request that you reference my book when appropriate;  its 
 Bibtex entry is:

 @book{Greenberg,
   author = "H.J. Greenberg",
   title  = "A Simplified Introduction to {\LaTeX}",
   publisher = "World Wide Web",
   address = "\url{http://mirror.ctan.org/info/simplified-latex/}",
   year = "1999--2010",
 }

 (You need to have \usepackage{url} in your preamble, described in the 
 book.)

 I welcome comments for future updates.*
