Package: gloss-occitan


The package provides a language definition file for use with plyglossia, which 
establishes Occitan conventions in a document even if Occitan is not the main 
language of the document.

Some functionalities have to be explicitly activated even if Occitan is the 
main language. Please read the documentation that explains why and what 
functionalities are not activated by default.

To install run the gloss-occitan.dtx file trough pdfLaTeX; you get with the 
same run both the language description file and the documentation. Then you 
have to move the created gloss-occitan.ldf file into a directory accessible 
by polyglossia.
