frletter

A small class for typesetting letters in France; no assumption is made 
about the language used. It represents a cosmetically modified beletter 
class, which itself is based on the letter class. Corresponding layout 
files were contributed on the Lyx Wiki.

The authors of the original beletter class are James Kilfiger and 
Frank Lenaerts. The contributor of frletter is Liviu Andronic.
