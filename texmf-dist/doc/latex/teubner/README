The bundle is distributed under the LPPL license version 1.3c or any later version.

The bundle has the status of author maintained.

The main purpose of this bundle is to provide classical philologists with 
some means for typesetting their documents that usually contain very 
specific mark up.
This version allows the typesetter to use both "italic" shapes: the Olga-like
and the Lipsian-like ones; it complies with the LICR (LaTeX Internal 
Character Representation) of the Greek glyphs that avoid the kerning problems 
that arise with the ligature mechanism embedded in the LGR encoded default 
CBfonts; it is compatible with the use of different vector Latin Type 1 
fonts; contains new designs for the horizontally stretchable markers, et 
cetera.

Running pdflatex on the .dtx file produces both the documentation and  
extracts the byproduct files teubner.sty, teubnertx.sty, teubner.pdf.  
The readable extended documentation file teubner-doc.pdf is obtained by 
running pdflatex on the teubner-doc.tex file.

Moreover this teubner package generates on the fly the font description files 
necessary to use the LGR encoded Greek fonts with some non standard TeX 
PostScript fonts; for example, it automatically generates the necessary 
files if using the TX or the PX fonts; with other Type 1 fonts the 
necessary .fd files require manual intervention, which simply means giving 
a suitable command from within another open file that loads teubner.

Please, be sure to work with a *2010* updated collection of the CBfonts; 
moreover with a *2019* or later updated version of the TeX system; with a
babel version 3.9g or later; with the language description file greek.ldf 
version 1.9b or later; package teubner, version 5.2 and later, patches the 
modifications of greek.ldf 1.10 so as cope with the ancient Greek numbering 
system. The teubner package does not work with previous versions of 
the above pieces of software; it may even produce fatal errors; therefore be sure to work only with a complete and up-to-date TeX system installation.
