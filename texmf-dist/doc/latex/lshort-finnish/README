    The not so Short Introduction to LaTeX  v3.22
    Finnish version
------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Original by Tobias Oetiker <oetiker@ee.ethz.ch>
    Finnish edition by Timo Hellgren 10/12/2002 <timo.hellgren@vtt.fi>
    
    If you want to learn how to write your documents with LaTeX,
    this introduction is for you. It is not about setting up a
    LaTeX system. While it is not as comprehensive as Lamport's book,   
    it should be sufficient in most cases.

    In this Finnish edition, I have included some additional
    information needed when Finnish documents are typesetted with LaTeX

    Besides this README file I have included ready-to-print PDF file
    with hyperlinks. (Made with pdfLaTeX.)

    The PDF version uses the Super Computer Modern collection of free
    Type 1 Postscript versions of the EC fonts (and the Cyrillic fonts
    as well). Times or ae packages could not be used because I wanted
    to demonstrate the full T1 character set in the document.
    
    Super Computer Modern fonts are found in CTAN:/fonts
    Note that the pfb files take space almost 60 Mb. Please, refer
    to the documentation for instructions how to install them.
    
    I couln't get them to work with Ghostscript in Windows, put
    pdflatex has no problems. Except I had to include the contents
    of the cm-super map-files into the file psfonts.map which is
    included in pdftex.cfg file [map psfonts.map] Go and figure...
    Well, try to follow the original instructions first, then
    try my way and read again your local guides.

    My original source files are also included.

    Oh, almost forgot---I had to change the index file by
    hand to get the umlauts sorted in the last positions
    of the alphabet like they are in Finnish and in Swedish.
