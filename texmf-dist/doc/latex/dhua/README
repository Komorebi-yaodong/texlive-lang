                README for the `dhua' package
           (German Abbreviations Using Thin Space)
                  (C) Uwe Lueck 2011/09/16


`dhua.sty' provides commands for German phrase abbreviations 
such as `d. h.' that are recommended to use a thin space -
set-up commands `\newdhua' and `\newtwopartdhua' as well as 
commands for single cases (e.g., `\zB' for `z. B.', to save you 
from typing `z.\,B.').  Package options support generating PDF 
and HTML from the same source and automatical use of `\xspace'.

  Das Paket `dhua' bietet Befehle fuer mehrgliedrige Abkuer-
  zungen, fuer die schmale Leerzeichen (Festabstaende) empfoh-
  len werden (Duden, Wikipedia). In die englische Paketdokumen- 
  tation sind deutsche Hinweise eingestreut.

KEYWORDs: German typography; 
          web typography, language support, macro programming
