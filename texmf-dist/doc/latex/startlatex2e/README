Title: Getting Started with LaTeX2e
Author: Michael P. Morris


Description:

‘Getting Stated with LaTeX2e’ is a short document aimed at helping complete novices with LaTeX create a document, format the text, then compile it into postscript or pdf format. It contains  information on writing the preamble, formatting the text, creating tables and inserting figures. 

I am interested in receiving any corrections or suggestions for improvements. They can be sent to the author at mmorris-500@hotmail.com. 
Finally, thank you for considering my short guide. I hope you find it helpful.
