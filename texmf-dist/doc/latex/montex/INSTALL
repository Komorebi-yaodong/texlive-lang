      System Requirements: e-LaTeX2e (limited functionality with LaTeX2e)
      			   Fonts in Cork encoding (T1) are
			   required; they are considered
			   to be an integral part of any
			   up-to-date LaTeX2e installation.

0. Introduction

MonTeX (Mongolian for LaTeX) is a modular package which provides
Mongolian to the LaTeX user community.

The present package represents Implementation Level IIa and provides
the Cyrillic script in immediate and transliteration modes.

In addition, it is possible to have short portions of Mongolian script
(`bicig') in the document, both horizontally and vertically, but for
enjoying vertical output it is necessary that PostScript support is
installed. Most modern LaTeX installations come with PostScript
anyway so this should not be a very difficult problem.

Subsequent implementation levels add more features: scripts, 
writing directions, etc.


1. Installation

Remove all old files of previous MonTeX Implementation Level I 
installations, including the font bitmaps (*.pk) and tfm files.

Unpack the archive montexivu.tgz in some temporary directory.

teTeX users can proceed to section 1.1, MikTeX users should read
section 1.2.


1.1 teTeX (and other TeX systems based on the TeX Directory Structure)

Create subdirectories, either in your main TeX installation, or
in any local tree, with the following structure:

	mkdir $TEXMF/tex/latex/montex/
	mkdir $TEXMF/fonts/source/public/mfinput/mls/
	mkdir $TEXMF/fonts/tfm/mls/
	mkdir $TEXMF/doc/montex/

Copy the appropriate contents into the newly created directories:

	cp $TMP/texinput/*	$TEXMF/tex/latex/montex/
	cp $TMP/mfinput/*	$TEXMF/fonts/source/public/mfinput/mls/
	cp $TMP/tfm/*		$TEXMF/fonts/tfm/mls/
	cp $TMP/doc/*		$TEXMF/doc/montex/

Rehash the file name database by executing texhash.

Execute texconfig and proceed to menu item <hyphenation>
for creating a format file with Mongolian hyphenation
patterns. You will have to edit the file language.dat (which
appears in the editor window automatically) and insert
the following line (perhaps somewhere after Hungarian (magyar)
and before Norwegian (norsk):

mongolian	mnhyphen.tex % mnhyphex.tex % No exceptions now.

in the list of languages.

There is no need to procure the graphics and rotating packages
externally since they are provided with teTeX.

GhostScript and GhostView are also regularly found on UNIX and
notably Linux systems so there should be full-fledged off-the-shelf
support for the vertical text capsules offered by MonTeX.

eLaTeX is included in modern teTeX versions, too.

Please also make sure you have the diagnose.sty tool somewhere,
as well as LGR Greek fonts.

1.2 MikTeX

Read and follow the instructions in the file MIKTEX.

Get the graphics package and the rotating packages as well as
GhostScript if you want to print portions of vertical Mongolian.

The latex packages can be found at CTAN (both in the Internet and
on CD-ROM) under

	macros/latex/packages/graphics
	macros/latex/contrib/supported/rotating

GhostScript versions can be found at CTAN, too, in the
/support/ghostscript/gnu subdirectory.


2. Running MonTeX

MonTeX is now ready for use. It is activated by stating

\usepackage{mls}

in the preamble of your document.

You can provide options for the document language and/or the 
input file encoding, like

\usepackage[xalx,mls]{mls}

which prepares a document in Modern Mongolian using the MLS
encoding. Consult doc/montex.tex for details.


3. General Remarks

When using MonTeX for the first time you may observe a
seemingly unusual font generating activity. By default,
MonTeX uses the T1 encoding, and requires these fonts
to be available. If you happened to use the old TeX font
encoding (known as OT1---and you may have been unconsciously
doing so for all your previous documents) then prepare
for anything between a few minutes and an hour (depending
on your system's speed) for the fonts to be computed.

This is a singular event and will not bother you later on.

The user documentation montex.tex contains many typeface
examples (in fact, unusually many for an average document)
so the display and printing of this document does not
reflect ordinary usage.


4. Points of Concern for emtex users
                         -----

emtex does not offer RL capabilities, and thus you will
not be able to generate pure Mongolian or Manju documents
on an emtex system. If you want to stick to a DOS-ish
environment then the fptex system, available on CTAN, is
recommended.

It is however possible to execute all the functions MonTeX
has been offering before Implementation Level IV.

Under emtex, the document montex.tex requires substantial
basic memory (below 640kB) for printing, and printing only.
The typeface demonstration contained in the documentation
loads a plethora of fonts (around twenty or so) which will
force emtex's printing program to abort if available
`conventional' memory is below 500 and a few kilobytes.
In this case there are basically two choices: temporarily
remove some device drivers, or start the program directly
from the DOS prompt. Shells (even like Norton Commander and
friends) sometimes eat exactly these 2 kB of memory which
decide on failure or success. If nothing helps, open the
file montex.tex in your editor, go to the line near no. 12
and change the parameter of "FontSamples" from "6" to "1".
You can now see whether the printer driver generates all
necessary fonts without problems. Increase the FontSamples
parameter step by step until all fonts are built, and try
to print the document again.
