MonTeX IVu.04.092


For updating to the latest MonTeX version, please eliminate
all remnants of former MonTeX installations from your computer,
and then install the actual version anew. Far too many files
have changed. Please be sure to include old font metric files
and old .pk fonts as well, as the fonts have been completely
reshuffled.
