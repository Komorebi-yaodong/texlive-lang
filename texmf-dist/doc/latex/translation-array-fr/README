You'll find here french translations of as many LaTeX documentations
as possible. As all those documents are in french and for french
users, all the informations files are in french. We guess it will not
hurt anybody. If it does, just tell us about it and we will write a
few informative files in english.

If you think the idea is interesting and you want to reproduce the
same project in another language, do not hesitate to contact us, we
can help, at least by giving you feedback about the way we work and
how we think it can be improved.

Happy TeXing,

                  the translation team.
