====================================

---------------------------------

Description
-----------

The class is derived from the LaTeX book document class. The extensions solve grammatical and numeration issues that occur when book-type documents are written in Basque.
The class is useful for writing books, PhD Theses, etc. in Basque.


Installation
-----------

To perform the installation, run basque-book.ins (in the same path of basque-book.dtx) through 
LaTeX. This action produces the following files: basque-book.cls and basque-book_[EUS].tex.

To finish the installation you have to move the basque-book.cls file into a directory 
searched by TeX.       
     
To produce the English documentation run the file basque-book.dtx through LaTeX.
To produce the Basque documentation run the file basque-book_[EUS].tex through LaTeX.



Usage
-----

\documentclass[<options>]{basque-book}

The document class basque-book provides the same options provided by the
standard book document class.
The document class basque-book requires the package basque-date.
Due to incompatibility reasons, the package babel should not be used when
the document class basque-book is called.
