Writing Scientific Documents Using LaTeX is an article introducing the use of
LaTeX in typesetting scientific documents. It covers the basics of creating a
new LaTeX document, special typesetting considerations, mathematical
typesetting and graphics. It also touches on bibliographic data and BibTeX.

Currently in its fifth edition, Writing Scientific Documents Using LaTeX is
periodically updated and extended and is a perpetual work-in-progress.

The file scidoc.pdf was generated from scidoc.tex using the `pdflatex' command.
A Makefile is provided for compatible UNIX systems.
