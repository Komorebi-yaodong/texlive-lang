mwcls is a set of document classes for LaTeX 2e designed with Polish
typographical tradition in mind.  Classes include: 'mwart' (which is a
replacement for 'article'), 'mwrep' ('report'), and 'mwbk' ('book').
Most features present in standard classes work with mwcls.  Some
extensions/exceptions include: sectioning commands allow for second
optional argument (it's possible to state different texts for running
head and for TOC), new environments 'itemize*' and 'enumerate*' for
lists with long items, page styles have variants for normal, opening,
closing, and blank pages.

Documentation is available as mwclsdoc.pdf (unfortunately in Polish
only).

To install run LaTeX like this
	latex mwcls.ins
and follow instructions on screen.
