                   (C) Uwe Lueck 2011/10/23

Here you find (i) files (in `source/') that demonstrate making 
an "HTML beamer presentation" with `blogdot.sty' from the 
`morehype' bundle (described in `blog.pdf'), (ii) a German 
sketch of package documentation and HTML generation based on 
`fifinddo.sty' (`nicetext' bundle): `dantev45.htm' 
(cf. `LIESMICH.txt').

TRYING the presentation: open `dantev45.htm' with a browser, 
click on "START", later click on screen bottom for next view 
or on lower right corner of screen for the overview. With MSIE 
however, this does not work, find something to click at right 
below the text.

VARIANTs: dantev45.htm is a "compromise" version of the 
presentation. Directory `variants' contains versions for different 
screens and browsers, exemplifying "recompilation" according to 
the `blogdot' documentation. 

KEYWORDs: beamer presentations, literate macro programming, HTML;
font selection, lists, punctuation, quotation, spacing, 
text decoration, computer text/verbatim text.
