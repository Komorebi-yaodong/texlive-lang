This package converts Silvio Levy's LaTeX209 "greek" package
(/tex-archive/fonts/greek/levy at the CTANs)
for use with LaTeX2e.
It uses (and requires) the fonts in Levy's package
(/tex-archive/fonts/greek/levy/mf).

Usage of the package is described in "lgreekuse.tex".
Basically, if you \usepackage{lgreek} then you can say

\begin{greek}
...
\end{greek}

In addition, if you \usepackage[delims]{greek}
then you can include greek inside $...$.

For details see "lgreekuse.tex".
