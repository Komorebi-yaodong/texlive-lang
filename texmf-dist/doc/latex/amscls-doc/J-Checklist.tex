\section{A checklist for using AMS journal classes}\label{sec:scheck}

\begin{itemize}
\item Most AMS journals
are published both in print and online.  In order to expedite
processing, the following restrictions are placed on
journal articles:
\begin{itemize}
\item Only ``public'' macro packages (packages available from
  \href{http://www.ctan.org/search.html}{CTAN}, the Comprehensive
  \TeX\ Archive Network) may be used.
\item Other macro definitions must be embedded in the preamble of
  the article file.  Files must
  be able to be processed
  independently with all macros (not entire macro files) included.
\item Macros should be defined with \ttcs{newcommand}, not with \ttcs{def}.
\end{itemize}

\item \the\AddHyperref
%
\item \the\ArticleTitleDesc
%
\item \the\ArticleTitleUC
%
\item \the\RunHeadJP
%
\item All AMS journal articles (except book reviews)
 must contain an \textbf{abstract}.
 The abstract should contain no \verb+\cite+s or text references to the
 bibliography unless the bibliographic reference is fully supplied. For
 example, [3] is meaningless to the reader once the abstract is separated
 from the article.
