\section{A checklist for using AMS proceedings and collections classes}\label{sec:scheck}

\begin{itemize}

\item \the\AddHyperref
 
\item \the\ArticleTitleDesc

\item \the\ArticleTitleUC

\item Include a brief \textbf{abstract} (optional for articles in
 proceedings volumes).
 This may comprise multiple paragraphs
 and include displayed material if appropriate. The length of the
 abstract depends primarily on the length of the article itself and on the
 difficulty of summarizing the material, but an upper limit of about
 150 words for short articles and 300 words for long articles is suggested.

\item \the\GrantsThanks

\item \the\FirstPageFootnotes

\item \the\RunHeadJP
 
\item \the\BiblioInFile

\item \the\AcadAffil
  
\item \the\ConsentToPublish
