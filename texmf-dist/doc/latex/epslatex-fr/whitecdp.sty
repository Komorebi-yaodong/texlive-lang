% This redefinition of the \cleardoublepage command provides
% for a special pagestyle for the "extra" pages which are generated
% to ensure that the chapter opener is on a recto page.
% The pagestyle is "chapterverso"; for many publishers, this should be
% identical to "empty", so that's the default.
