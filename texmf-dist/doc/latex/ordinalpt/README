INTRODUCTION
============

The package _ordinalpt_ provides a counter style (like \arabic, \alph
and others) but that produces as output strings like `primeiro' (first
in Portuguese), `segundo' (second), `terceiro' (third), etc, up to
`mil\'esimo noningent\'esimo nonag\'esimo nono' (1999th).  There are
counter commands to output the text in UPPERCASE, Capitalized or in
lowercase, with masculine or feminine gender.

USER COMMANDS
=============

\ordptmasc{counter} --> ordinals in lowercase masculine
\Ordptmasc{counter} --> ordinals in capitalized masculine
\ORDPTMASC{counter} --> ordinals in uppercase masculine
\ordptfem{counter}  --> ordinals in lowercase feminine
\Ordptfem{counter}  --> ordinals in capitalized feminine
\ORDPTFEM{counter}  --> ordinals in uppercase feminine

PACKAGE OPTIONS
===============

In Portuguese, both
  `und\'ecimo'     and `d\'ecimo primeiro' (for 11th)
  `duod\'ecimo'    and `d\'ecimo segundo'  (for 12th)
  `tred\'ecimo'    and `d\'ecimo terceiro' (for 13th)
  `tricent\'esimo' and `trecent\'esimo'    (for 300th)
  `sexcent\'esimo' and `seiscent\'esimo'   (for 600th)
  `noningent\'esimo' and `nongent\'esimo'  (for 900th)
are correct forms for ordinals.

It is common to find the shorter forms for 11th and 12th, but a bit
harder to find to shorter form for 13th.  If this later is used, then
all 11th up to 13th should be in shorter forms.

So there are the options to set the output for resp. for 11th, 12th and 13th
  11-12-curtos (default) -> und\'ecimo, duod\'ecimo, d\'ecimo terceiro
  11-13-curtos       -> und\'ecimo, duod\'ecimo, tred\'ecimo
  11-13-longos   -> d\'ecimo primeiro, d\'ecimo segundo, d\'ecimo terceiro

To choose ordinals 300th, 600th and 900th, use
  tricentesimo (default)   or trecentesimo
  sexcentesimo (default)   or seiscentesimo
  noningentesimo (default) or nongentesimo
