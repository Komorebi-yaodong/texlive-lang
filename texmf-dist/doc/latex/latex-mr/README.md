This is a short guide to {\LaTeX} and its package polyglossia. This document aims to introduce {\LaTeX} and polyglossia for Indian languages. Though the document often  discusses the language Marathi, the discussion applies to other India languages also with some minute changes which are described in Section~\ref{sec:first-doc}. We also discuss some issues in polyglossia for Marathi, Sanskrit and Hindi, and solutions of some of them. The issues for other Indian languages should be similar and have same solutions.
