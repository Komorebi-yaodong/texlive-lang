%% CHAPTERS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Add your chapters, each in a sepparate .tex file


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% BIBLIOGRAPHY
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% This is tricky.  There is a difference between 'bibliography' and 'references'.  'Bibliography' is all the literature you used in your research, whether you cited them explictly or not.  'References' are the specific entries you have cited and your work is referred to.

%% Therefore, if you are using 'Bibliography', the whole section in the main file ('Template_EN.tex') should look like this:

% \renewcommand{\bibname}{Bibliography}
% \phantomsection
% \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography}
% \begin{singlespace}
	% \nocite{*}
	% \bibliographystyle{IEEEtranSN}
	% \bibliography{References}								% Bibliography/References [.bib file]
% \end{singlespace}
% \clearemptydoublepage

%% If you are using 'References':

% \renewcommand{\bibname}{References}
% \phantomsection
% \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{References}
% \begin{singlespace}
	% \bibliographystyle{IEEEtranN}
	% \bibliography{References}								% Bibliography/References [.bib file]
% \end{singlespace}
% \clearemptydoublepage
