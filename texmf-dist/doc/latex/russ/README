% ===============================================================
% The package aims to facilitate Russian typesetting (based on input
% using MicroSoft Code Page 1251).
% If you are going to use another encoding just type
% \usepackage[ENCODING]{inputenc}
% Russian hyphenation is selected, and various mathematical commands
% are set up in Russian style.
% Furthermore all Cyrillic letters’ catcodes are set to “letter”,
% so that commands with Cyrillic letters in their names may be defined.
% Also Cyrillic letters are declared as math symbol, so you can
% use it in formulas.
% glyphtounicode.tex included, so there is no problem with
% Cyrillics in PDF (copy-paste)
