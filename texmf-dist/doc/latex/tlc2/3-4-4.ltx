\begin{document}
Text before listing environment.
\begin{listing*}[2]{3}
The listing environment numbers the
lines in it.  It takes an optional
argument, which is the step between
numbered lines (line 1 is always
numbered if present), and a required
argument, which is the starting line.
The star form makes blanks visible.
\end{listing*}
Text between listing environments.
\begin{listingcont}
This listingcont environment continues
where the previous listing environment
left off.  Both the listing and
listingcont environments expand tabs
with a default tab width of 8.
\end{listingcont}
Text following listing environments.
