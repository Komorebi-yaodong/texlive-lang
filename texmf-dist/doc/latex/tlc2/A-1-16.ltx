\begin{document}
The \vspace{3mm}use of a \verb!\vspace! command
inside a paragraph is considered somewhat odd.
It could perhaps be used with a negative space
value to get rid of redundant space.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

Between paragraphs, adjusting the spacing is
somewhat more useful, and it allows control
of the white space before and after displayed
material.
