The \textbf{Latin Modern} fonts are carefully
handcrafted PostScript Type~1 fonts based on the
designs of Knuth's \emph{Computer Modern}
families. They contain all the glyphs needed to
typeset Latin-based European languages.  At the
moment the \texttt{T1} and \texttt{TS1} encodings
are supported.  In a later step the project will
address glyphs needed for typesetting Native
American, Vietnamese, and Transliteration. Also
planned are 8-bit math encodings (based on
earlier work by \textsc{Clasen/Vieth} and
\textsc{Ziegler}~[40,174]).
