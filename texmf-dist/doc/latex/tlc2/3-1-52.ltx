 In this case we center a word printed
 vertically inside the paragraph. It is not
 difficult to understand that tables can also
 be easily included with the \texttt{tabwindow}
 environment.\par When a paragraph ends, like

 then it just continues past the paragraph
 boundary, right into the next one(s).
