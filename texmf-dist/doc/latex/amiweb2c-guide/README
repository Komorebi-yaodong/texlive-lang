LaTeX on the Amiga - Old-School
--------------------------------


This is a guide to the installation of the LaTeX distribution Amiweb2c in the version 2.1 on an emulated AmigaÂ 4000 computer running Workbench 3.1. Furthermore the installation of a LaTeX server for calling LaTeX from an editor is given and some tips on the installation of new fonts are detailed.

This work is the result of of many a nights tinkering by an amateur who had to make it up as he went along. It cannot claim in any way to be authorative or complete and is written in the hope that it will help fellow nostalgians embarked on a similar quest.

No copyright infringement or monetary gain is intended and if implementing any of the commands given in this guide breaks your system or leads to loss of data or gives you a headache...you are on your own.

This package consists of the file Amiweb2cGuide.pdf and its source file amiweb2c-guide.tex exported from the original .lyx-file. The file amiweb2c-guide.dvi has been obtained from the .tex-file by compiling it with Amiweb2c-TeX on an emulated Amiga.
