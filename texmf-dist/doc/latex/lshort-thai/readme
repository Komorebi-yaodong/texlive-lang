Not so short introduction to LaTeX v1.32

This is a Thai translation of LShort by Tobias Oetiker.
In this version the thailatex-0.2.5 scheme distributed 
along with Linux.TLE 4.1 upward has been employed.
Thai words indexing has also been demonstrated.

Aim of the translation is to provide a handy tutorial
for LaTeX newcommers. 

For more information of how to build please have a look
at LaTeX source files. 

Note:
v1.25 use cttex with thai.sty (Vuthichai Ampornaramveth)
v1.32 use swath with thailatex-0.2.5 (Thai Linux Working
      Group, Phaisarn Charoenpornsawat, 
      Theppitak Karoonboonyanan, Chanop Silpa-Anan)
