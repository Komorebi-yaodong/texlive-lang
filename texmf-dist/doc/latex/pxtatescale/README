pxtatescale
===========

LaTeX: to make scaling work also with vertical direction of (u)pTeX
and dvipdfmx

The graphics' feature of "scaling" (`\scalebox`, `\reflextbox` and
`\resizebox`) with dvipdfmx driver results in a wrong direction of
stretch, when used in the vertical direction of pTeX. This behavior
is caused by the fact that internal X and Y directions of pTeX
`\tate` mode correspond to physical top-to-bottom and right-to-left
directions respectively. This package provides a fix for the problem.

### Installation

  - `*.sty` â†’ $TEXMF/tex/latex/pxtatescale

### Usage

Load this package after graphicx (or graphics) package.

    \documentclass[dvipdfmx]{article}
    \usepackage{graphicx} % or graphics
    \usepackage{pxtatescale}

Note that this package is of no use unless you work on e-(u)pTeX +
dvipdfmx combination.
