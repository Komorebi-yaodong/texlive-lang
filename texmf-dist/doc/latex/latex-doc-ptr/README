latex-doc-ptr

  This is intended as the document that comes up when a person runs 
'texdoc latex'.  The idea is that an exhaustive reference for LaTeX
is not what the overwhelming majority of users would find useful at
that point.  Instead, it gives a selection of resources, for a
variety of users.

Install:
  If you have a recent TeX distribution,
    pdflatex latex-doc-ptr
should do nicely.

  My version of TeX is old, so I have some trouble with tex4ht.  If you
are in my situation then try the Makefile, which does a lot of hacking.


Notes:

1) My version of make4ht requires that I change
    \def\IfFileExists#1#2#3{%
to
    \long\def\IfFileExists#1#2#3{%
in a local copy of tex4ht.sty.  See https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/423729/339
