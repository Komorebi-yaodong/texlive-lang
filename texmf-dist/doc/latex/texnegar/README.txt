The TEXNEGAR package
------------------------

In some cursive scripts such as Persian or Arabic, kashida is used to create
justification. In this type of justification characters are elongated rather
than expanding spaces between words.

The kashida justification in 'xepersian' has many bugs. Also it has problems
with some fonts such as 'HM Series' available at
'https://dma8hm1334.bitbucket.io' and 'X Series 2' available at
'http://wiki.irmug.com/index.php/X_Series_2'. The 'xepersian-hm' package was
the first attempt to fix these bugs in 'xepersian' which uses the xetex
engine.

This package extends the kashida justification to be used with the luatex
engine too.

The files 'texnegar-*.tex' in the directory 'texmf-dist/doc/xelatex/texnegar/'
can be used as simple examples of the usage of the package.

Please use the Bitbucket issue tracker:
'https://bitbucket.org/dma8hm1334/texnegar/issues' to report a bug, request
a feature or if you have a comment.

I will do my best to fix all the bugs you report, but, unfortunately, time is a
big hurdle to overcome; so, my apologies in advance for those which I cannot
make time to fix.
