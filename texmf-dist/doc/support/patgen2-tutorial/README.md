This the revisited version of a document written in 1993, long before Unicode, the PDF format, 
the Web, the $n$-th Doctors (for nâ‰¥9), \eTeX, smartphones, emojis, fake news, COVID, 
and whatever makes the world we currently live in. As a tutorial, it was utterly _bad_: 
it was unclear, missed important information and focalized on (semi-private) jokes. 
I realized this fact in March 2021, when I tried to use Patgen again after decades of oblivion. 
Having re-discovered the use of Patgen, which is still as scarcely documented as it was in 1993, 
I decided to rewrite this tutorial hoping to succeed where I once failed. I ask in advance for 
your indulgence. Do not hesitate to contact me if parts of it are (still) obscure!
