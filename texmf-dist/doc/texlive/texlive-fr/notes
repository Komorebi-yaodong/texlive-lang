Notes sur la VF

1976: trop d'espace avant le alltt, ou pas assez après. À régler dans le
préambule ?

Suggestions pour texlive-en.tex
-------------------------------

win32 supported: add Seven

3.1: be clearer about admin install (in general)

Ajout df, fin de 1.1 : 
Les utilisateurs des éditions précédentes de \TL{} sont invités
à lire, \emph{avant toute mise à jour}, la section~\ref{sec:tlcurrent}
page~\pageref{sec:tlcurrent} qui présente les principaux changements intervenus
cette année.

233: the translated README's are no more at the top-level, but
in readme-*.dir as described above.

244: maybe mention that the TeX Live documentation is what the
reader is currently reading?

271: addition by df: nothing should be manually added, modified
of removed from this tree. (mpg: actually, this is a common mistake)

326: addition by df: eg, \dirname{texmf/tex/latex} for you
personnal LaTeX macros files.

369: xetex/ (trailing slash)

678: the numbering is weird (a, c, e, f, ...) and 

804: additional precisions here may be useful, like:
"The default paper size selection for tools such as \prog{dvips}, \prog{pdftex},
\prog{xdvi}. It does not influence, and may be overridden by, the default paper
size used by macros such as the LaTeX classes and packages. Of course,
individual document..."

816: is it clear for everyone that the context here is \write18?
"execution of external programs" does not seem explicit enough to me.

1042: s/filename/pkgname/

1053: Isn't conf.d Debian-specific?

1142: "this" looks like it means "using XeTeX", but probably
refers to "installing fonts". 

1236: the first sentence is about system fonts, while the end of
the paragraph says \TL fonts. Which one is correct?

1267: quite messy, sometimes the description says "is free
software", sometimes not. We'd better say "all are free software unless stated
otherwise". We could say which items are Windows-only. Why is there 2 Emacs
items? Concerning Vim, add a reference to latex-suite. Why not put TW first,
then other free cross-platform software, then free platform-specific, then
non-free? Add Kile for Linux?

1296: the term "installation" may be confusing (I thought it was
about the net installer first), maybe "using TL from a network" would be better?

1340: addition by df: nothing is touched on the host system
outside ~/.tlportable2009

1389: s/location/repository/

1506: IMO, TeXworks should come first, and Perl/GS last (I doubt
the average user cares about it).

1544: s/Xe\TeX/\XeTeX/ (in other places, too)

1562: this section sounds rather theoretical: how does all this relate to TL?

3076: Final note on the past is \section{Present}???

Suggestions pour texlive-en.sty
-------------------------------

- TeXworks logo, XeTeX logo?
- More systematic use of \xspace?
