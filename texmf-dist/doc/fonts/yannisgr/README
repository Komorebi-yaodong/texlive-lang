Run all the fonts with \mag:=1; Run rgrrg10 also with \mag:=.9;. Make sure
that the fonts cmssqi8 and mcyr10 are available. Same thing for tugbot.sty
and tugbot.com (version 0.5 at least). Run rgrpaper.tex (this is a NEW version 
of "Y. Haralambous, K. Thull, Typesetting modern greek with 128 character 
codes, TUGboat 10 (1989) 354-359).
 
Read it!
 
If you want to make a greek format, remove "\input hyphen.tex" from plain.tex,
and replace by the contents of tomakeformat.txt.
 
If you want to make the PASCAL word processor mentionned in rgrpaper, you
will find in monsyl.txt a list of monosyllabes.
 
That's it. If you are a satisfied user you can send me a postcard for my
collection (or perhaps some work you have done with this package), else send
me your remarks and complaints. My email is
