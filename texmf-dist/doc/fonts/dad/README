0 CHANGES IN V1.2
=================

I added support for LuaTeX 0.95 by including package luatex85 and by changing \luatextextdir into \textdir in file dad.sty.


1 INTRODUCTION
==============

This LaTeX package allows simple typesetting in Arabic script, intended for mixed Latin-Arabic script usage, in situations where heavy-duty solutions are discouraged.
The ض system operates with both Unicode and transliterated input, allowing the user to choose the most appropriate approach for every situation.

A paper describing the package has been submitted to TUGboat.

A bug report should contain:

  warning messages.
* \errorcontextlines=\maxdimen can be added in the
  TeX code to get more information in TeX error messages.
* Minimal test file that shows the problem, but does not
  contain any unnecessary packages and code.
* Used drivers/programs.
* Version information about used packages and programs.

  a list of version information is printed at the end
  of the LaTeX run.

  The other files .log, .dvi, .ps, .pdf are seldom
  necessary, so send them only on request.
