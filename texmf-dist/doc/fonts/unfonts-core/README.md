## GPL and font embedding

These fonts are under the (pure) GNU General Public License, with no
exception about embedding in a document. So you should take care
about the license influence when your non-GPLed document embeds one of
these fonts.

This licensing problem has already been reported to the upstream years
ago but the upstream was not active on this discussion. Currently the
upstream looks dead.

For your information about this issue:

- The font embedding exception which FSF suggests:
  http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-faq.html#FontException
- Fedora wiki page about font licensing:
  http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Fonts/Legal
