                           The Kerkis Font Family
                                  For LaTeX

                         version 1.11, 05/Sep/2020

   Among other features, Kerkis for LaTeX makes wide use of double forms
   for several letters according to the hellenic typographic tradition
   that now tends to be lost. In particular the letters beta, zeta, theta,
   rho and phi have an initial and a different middle-word form.

   Old style numbers (known as lower case numbers as well) are included in
   the small caps font. Thus they are accessible with the \textsc or
   \scshape command.

   The fonts contain a full set of latin characters with accents that
   support properly all latin-based languages (common like German, French
   etc and less common like Icelandic). Special ligatures for "northern"
   languages like ij and fj etc (try the word fiji or fjord) are also
   included and tested to work.

   Kerkis is especially usefull for the creation of pdf files due to the
   fact that the fonts are in Type1 format.

                                Installation

   If you have the previous version of kerkis installed you must first
   remove it or overwrite it. To do this or just to install it do the
   following steps:
    1. Replace or place the type1 files: locate the old files named k.pfb,
       ki.pfb, kb.pfb etc and delete them. Place the new files in the same
       place you had the old ones probably in texmf/fonts/type1/kerkis or
       in this directory (create it!) if you did not had kerkis before.
    2. Replace or place the afm files: locate the files k.afm,
       ki.afm,kb.afm etc and delete them. Place the new afm files in the
       same place you had the old ones probably in texmf/fonts/afm/kerkis
       or in this directory (create it!) if you did not had kerkis before.
    3. Replace or place the tfm and vf files (k8a.tfm, ek8a.tfm, gk7a.tfm
       etc), in texmf/fonts/tfm/kerkis and texmf/fonts/vf/kerkis.
    4. Replace or place the old kerkis.sty, .fd files from the tex
       subdirectory of the distribution in texmf/tex/latex/kerkis.
    5. Replace or place the .enc files from the dvips subdirectory of the
       distribution in texmf/dvips/base/kerkis (old ones might be in
       texmf/dvips/base/).
    6. Place the all html files from the doc subdirectory in
       texmf/doc/latex/kerkis.
    7. Place the kerkis.map file in texmf/dvips/base/kerkis. If you had
       kerkis before edit the file psfonts.map (found in
       texmf/dvips/config and/or texmf/dvips/base) and delete all entries
       relating to kerkis.
    8. Run texhash (on unix) or refresh the filename database (in MikTeX).
    9. Find the file updmap.cfg open it in an editor and add the line: Map
       kerkis.map
   10. Run updmap (on MikTeX I am not sure how to do this. Alternatively
       you may append the contents of the file kerkis.map of the
       distribution to psfonts.map after step 7 above, refresh the
       filename database (step 8) and skip steps 9 and 10).
   11. Remove all bitmaps you may have from older kerkis instalations
       (remove all .pk files in /var/lib/texmf/pk teTeX (on unix)
       texmf-var/fonts/pk in TeXLive and localtexmf\fonts\pk in MikTeX.

   You are ready to use the fonts now. Just note the following:
   1. Load the kerkis.sty package after you load the inputenc package with
       the iso-8859-7 option

   2. The -j option of dvips (which is usually the default) may not work
       properly with older TeX installations (it works with modern ones).
       If you run into such problems with dvips, either turn it off by
       issuing dvips -j0 file.dvi or use the bitmap generation utility
       gfstopk by issuing dvips -V file.dvi

                              Stylistic issues
       Kerkis is a Neoclassical font. We believe that its strictly
       rationalist axis makes it ideal for scientific typesetting.
       Moreover its moderate contrast and apperture makes it perfectly
       readable. Its serifs are adnate so that it guides your eyes
       smoothly on the line.
       Kerkis is a calm and quiet face that does not interfere with the
       expression of important ideas in your documents.
       The latin part of the Kerkis font is URW Bookman (except some
       characters that were missing from Bookman). URW has kindly allowed
       us to re-distribute their Bookman inside Kerkis.
