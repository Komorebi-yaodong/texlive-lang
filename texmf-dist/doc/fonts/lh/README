lhfonts 3.5g
Cyrillic alphabet fonts ("LH") with support of LaTeX standard encodings.

     The LH fonts address the problem  of the wide variety  of alphabets
     that are written with Cyrillic-style characters.  The fonts are the
     original basis of the set of T2* and X2 encodings that are now used
     when LaTeX users need to write in Cyrillic languages.

     There are also offered the latex/lh bundle of packages for standard
     LaTeX Cyrillic and traditional encodings.
