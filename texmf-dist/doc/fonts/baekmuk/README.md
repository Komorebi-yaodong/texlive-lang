## Changes on CTAN

- 2020-11-08 Baekmuk Fonts v2.2.1

  - Replace buggy version 2.0 `post` tables with version 3.0 ones, which
    indicate that the font doesn't contain glyph names.  This is common for
    CJK fonts that are accessed by character code only.

  - Set the font revision to 4.1 and the font version to 2.0.1 in all fonts
    to emphasize that they belong together, which makes sense IMHO because
    the fonts are no longer under development.

- 2016-09-19 Baekmuk Fonts v2.2
  (the original archive "865-baekmuk-ttf-2.2.tar.gz" was re-packaged)
