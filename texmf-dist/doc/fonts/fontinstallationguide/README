ABOUT

The Font Installation Guide discusses the most common scenarios you
are likely to encounter when installing Type 1 Postscript fonts.
While the individual tools employed in the installation process are
documented well, the actual difficulty most users are facing when
trying to install new fonts is understanding how to put all the
pieces together. This is what this guide is about.
