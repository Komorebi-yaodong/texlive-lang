Overview
--------
Ibycus4 is a Greek typeface, based on Silvio Levy's
realization of a classic Didot cut of Greek type from around
1800.  It is accompanied by a set of macro packages to use
it with Plain TeX or LaTeX 2e.

See the file NEWS for a summary of the latest changes.


Installing
----------
The below installation instructions assume a TDS-compliant
TeX system, in particular teTeX or MikTeX.  The directory
name "texmf" refers to the root directory of a TDS directory
tree.  In case your TeX systems has more than one directory
tree, its documentation should tell you where to install new
files.

In case you have installed a previous release of the Ibycus4
system, delete

* the directory 
  texmf/fonts/vf/public/ibycus/ 

* the file 
  texmf/dvips/iby.map

* and the files
  texmf/fonts/tfm/public/ibycus4/fibo.pl
  texmf/fonts/tfm/public/ibycus4/fibo.tfm
  texmf/fonts/tfm/public/ibycus4/fibr.pl
  texmf/fonts/tfm/public/ibycus4/fibr.tfm
  texmf/fonts/type1/public/ibycushtg-regular.pfb (or .pfa)
  
before installing the new release.

To install Ibycus 4, v4.5, 

  * Copy the everything from the directories doc, fonts and 
  tex of the distribution to the corresponding directories 
  texmf/doc, texmf/fonts and texmf/tex of your TeX system.

  * Update the file name data base of your TeX system (if
  applicable),

  * Add the information from the font mapping file
  texmf/fonts/map/dvips/ibycus4/iby.map to the configuration
  of dvips, pdfTeX and related programs.  
  See the documentation of your TeX system for the details.
  In particular, your TeX system may expect map files in a
  different directory such as texmf/dvips/config; move
  iby.map to that directory, if necessary.
  Make sure that there is no further file named "iby.map"
  from a previous Ibycus version around!

Finally read the text file README, which should have been
installed in the directory texmf/doc/generic/ibycus4/ of the
TDS directory tree.  It describes the usage of the Ibycus4
system.
