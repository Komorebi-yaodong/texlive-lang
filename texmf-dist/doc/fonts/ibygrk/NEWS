                      Ibycus4 -- News
============================================================

2004-10-27, version 4.5

  Changed directory structure to comply with TDS 1.1.
  
  The bold Ibycus font, too, is now available in Postscript
  format.  It was converted from Metafont to Type1 by Harald
  Harders <h.harders@tu-bs.de>, and is available as
  fibb84.pfb + fibb84.afm.  A record for this font has been
  added to the map file iby.map.
  
  Font file IbycusHTG-Regular.pfb renamed to fibr84.pfb, to
  comply with Karl-Berry-scheme; map file changed
  accordingly.  The font should now work flawlessly with
  Acrobat Reader 5; special thanks to Peter Heslin and Ralf
  Stubner, who succeeded to find and fix a long-standing
  bug.
  
  Fixed definition of the macro \greek, so as to work 
  also with default font encodings other than OT1.
  
  New text-generating command \textgreek as a counterpart to
  the declaration \greek.

  Changed font definition file Uibycus.fd:  
  * only those fonts are used, that exist actually as Type1;
  * fonts are declared as scalable; 
  * font definitions now work with VTeX, too.
  
  Regular Ibycus font is used as a 1:1 substitute for the 
  MF font now, without going via a virtual font.  
  Virtual fonts and related font metrics are gone.
 
  Proper identification messages (\ProvidesPackage) in all
  LaTeX macro files
  
  Patched pssetiby.tex so that only Type1 fonts are used,
  and that it works with VTeX.
