The greektex package.

The files of this package make it possible to process with
LaTeX2e files written in "Greeklish", i.e., a mixture of Greek
and English. They are based on Silvio Levy's classical Greek
("plain") fonts, and they have evolved from earlier distributions
for Latex209, in 1993 by Moschovakis and in 1994 by Moschovakis
and Spiliotis. To use them, you need to have an ASCII editor that
can handle mixed Greek and English input, such as notepad or
(better) winedt, and a full LaTeX2e installation with the
capability to automatically compile metafont files when they are
called, e.g., Miktex or a linux installation.

To install and use these fonts, you need the following files, posted here:

ywcl.zip          This contains all the metafont files necessary
                  to produce the Greek fonts.

greektexdoc.pdf   The document (in Greek).

greektexdoc.tex   The texfile of the document (as a sample).

greektex.sty      The main package.

gehyphw.gr        The hyphenation file.

You should print greektexdoc.pdf, which has detailed instructions
(in Greek) for installing and using this package and also
illustrates the "look" of the fonts.

As far as we know, all the programs in this package are in the
public domain and they are offered without any obligation or
guarantee, with the usual proviso that if you change any files you
should also change their names.
